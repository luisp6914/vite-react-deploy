            <div>
                <p>
                  I'm a recent graduate of the Class of 2024 with a 
                  passion for both front-end and back-end development. Throughout my educational career, 
                  I have developed my abilities and I'm excited to bring my knowledge and enthusiasm to the professional world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding, you'll often find me immersed in video games and embracing 
                  the challenges they offer. I also have a passion for basketball, 
                  whether it's playing a pickup game with friends or watching the latest Lakers Game.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Graduating in 2024 marks the beginning of an exciting chapter in my life, and I can't 
                  wait to embark on my career. I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects, collaborate 
                  with talented individuals, and continue learning and growing in this ever-evolving field.
